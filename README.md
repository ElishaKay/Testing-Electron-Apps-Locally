Spectron demo in Electron
=========================

This demo project shows how to incorporate [Spectron](http://electron.atom.io/spectron/) into your Electron applications. Using Spectron you 
can do [end-to-end](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_testing_dictionary/end_to_end_testing.htm) testing on your application to verify 
core pieces of functionality are correct.

The main Electron project was built on top of Electron's [quick start repository](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start).

This repository hosts the code for two blog posts regarding Spectron:
- [End-To-End Testing Electron Apps With Spectron](http://devcenter.wintellect.com/jwood/end-end-testing-electron-apps-spectron)
- [Creating Page Files For Spectron Tests](http://devcenter.wintellect.com/jwood/creating-page-files-spectron-tests)

To run the tests:
===========

Execute
    npm install
    npm run test:e2e
